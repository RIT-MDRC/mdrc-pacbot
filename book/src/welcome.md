Welcome to Pacbot!

We are part of RIT's Multi-Disciplinary Robotics Club, a student-led organization that aims to teach, create, 
and manage robotics projects, using skills learned across electrical, mechanical, and software engineering. Pacbot
requires collaboration across all three disciplines.

Our team focuses on developing a small fully autonomous robot to play the arcade game Pac-Man on a physical field.
Our annual competition is in April, where we compete against other Pacbot teams from various universities. A
