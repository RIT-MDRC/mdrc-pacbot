# Rust API

Our code is done entirely in Rust, a modern systems programmings language focused on speed and memory safety. If you
don't know Rust, check out [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

You can read more about each crate in the repository Readme.

Auto-generated documentation for the Rust code can be found at [https://rit-mdrc.github.io/mdrc-pacbot/api/core_pb/](https://rit-mdrc.github.io/mdrc-pacbot/api/core_pb/)
